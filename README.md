# Plant-Environment-Monitoring-System
The user will monitor the environment surrounding a plant. 
The user will use a temperature sensor and light sensor (photoresistor ) in order to monitor the temperature and light around the plant 
(indicating if the temp is hot/moderate/col,  and if there is enough light around the plant) , and the user will use a soil moisture sensor 
in order to know when the plant needs to be watered. In addition, a submersible water pump motor to water the plant when needed. 
The user will be able to read all the info (temperature, light, and soil moisture values) from the serial monitor. Moreover, the user 
can also write to the serial monitor (enter ‘i’ for info, ‘c’ to check if the plant needs water, ‘w’ to pump water… etc.). 
Also the user will use LEDs (with 560 resistors) to indicate the state of a plant (red: needs water, green: doesn’t need water, blue: is 
pumping watered to plant).
